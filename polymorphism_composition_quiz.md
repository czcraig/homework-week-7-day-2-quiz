# Polymorphism & Composition Homework - Quiz

# Polymorphism

1. What does the ___word___ 'polymorphism' mean?
Polymorphism allows an object to take many forms

2. What does it mean when we apply polymorphism to OO design? Give a simple Java example.
It means it allow to treat a class as the same as the abstract class or the class it inherited from. it allows us to call the same methods and has the same variables. you can have a driver abstract class and two subclasses bus driver and taxi driver. you can write the method start engine and both of the subclasses have that method.


3. What can we use to implement polymorphism in Java?
 Abstract classes and Inheritance.


4. How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism?
There is no limit to how many forms an object can take.


5. Give an example of when you could use polymorphism.
When you have multiple classes that are similar for example, fighter plane, jumbo jet, helicopter. you can have a abstract class called flying machine.
You could have a method called take off used by all of the classes.



# Composition

6. What do we mean by 'composition' in reference to object-oriented programming?
 Composition is when we break down something to what is has, what an object is made up of.

7. When would you use composition? Provide a simple example in Java.
you could plane class and also other classes such as rudder class, turbineEngine class and flaps class.

8. What is/are the advantage(s) of using composition?
you implement multiple classes unlike when using inheritance.

9. What happens to the behaviours when the object composed of them is ?
All of the behaviours of the object are also destroyed.
